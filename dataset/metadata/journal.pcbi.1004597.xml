		<title>Distinctive Behaviors of Druggable Proteins in Cellular Networks</title>
		<description>
		The interaction environment of a protein in a cellular network is important in defining the role
that the protein plays in the system as a whole, and thus its potential suitability as a drug target.
Despite the importance of the network environment, it is neglected during target selection
for drug discovery. Here, we present the first systematic, comprehensive computational
analysis of topological, community and graphical network parameters of the human interactome
and identify discriminatory network patterns that strongly distinguish drug targets from
the interactome as a whole. Importantly, we identify striking differences in the network
behavior of targets of cancer drugs versus targets from other therapeutic areas and explore
how they may relate to successful drug combinations to overcome acquired resistance to
cancer drugs. We develop, computationally validate and provide the first public domain predictive
algorithm for identifying druggable neighborhoods based on network parameters.
We also make available full predictions for 13,345 proteins to aid target selection for drug
discovery. All target predictions are available through canSAR.icr.ac.uk. Underlying data
and tools are available at https://cansar.icr.ac.uk/cansar/publications/druggable_network_
neighbourhoods/.
